TRIGGER WARNING: this blog post contains information on gun deaths, specifically suicide.

Suicide is the tenth highest cause of death in the united states. There are approximately 135 people affected for every one suicide and around fifty thousand suicides in 2018 alone. It is obvious that suicide and depression are major problems in the US that have affected millions of people.
To explore this further I have taken a dataset from the CDC that documents gun deaths between 2012 and 2014. Nearly 65,000 of these gun deaths were suicides. I looked at numerous variables involving the suicides in this dataset. The most prevalent correlation was with age.
