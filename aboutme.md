### My story

Since I was in middle school I loved building things, a gas-powered blow-dart gun, a small crossbow made of popsicle sticks, fireworks, and anything else a 13-year-old could get away with building before his mother put a stop to it.

I have been an engineer for as long as I can remember. I knew since middle school that I wanted to get a degree in Chemical Engineering. It wasn't until recently, after taking math classes and physics classes in college that I didn't know what I wanted to do. There were so many options, so many things that piqued my interest. Then I discovered Data Science. From then on I began pursuing a career in Data Science.

At Lambda school I spent six months learning all of the fundamentals needed to become a notable Data Scientist. I learned Python, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Computer Science, how to work on a team to deliver viable products, and most importantly at Lambda, I learned the ability to successfully retain new concepts.
